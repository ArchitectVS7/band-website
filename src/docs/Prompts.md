Make sure to:
- Create the complete ThemeContext with localStorage persistence
- Update tailwind.config.js with the underground color system and fonts
- Add all required Google Fonts to index.html
- Replace the existing CSS with underground-appropriate styling
- Test that theme switching works and persists across browser sessions

Implement the innovative Community Archive Project and complete the underground feature set as detailed in Phase 4 of the Action Plan.

This is the key differentiator - reference the "Community Archive Project" description in the SRD and follow the comprehensive implementation in Phase 4 of the Conversion Plan. Also update the Music section to prioritize Bandcamp and underground distribution.

Build these features:
- Complete CommunityArchive component with filtering, upload modal, and fan contribution system
- Update Music section with Bandcamp-first approach and demo archive integration
- Convert remaining sections (Tour, Contact) to underground terminology and values
- Ensure all new features work seamlessly with the admin system and theme variants

Test the complete Community Archive workflow: filtering ‚Üí upload form ‚Üí contribution display ‚Üí verification system.

Complete the underground styling system and visual polish as specified in Phase 5 of the Action Plan.

Reference the detailed style guide variants in the SRD and follow the CSS implementation specifications in Phase 5 of the Conversion Plan. Focus on creating the authentic underground aesthetic while maintaining technical excellence.

Implement:
- All underground component utility classes (.underground-btn-primary, .underground-card, etc.)
- Theme-specific typography utilities and proper font switching
- Underground-appropriate animations (pulse, slide-up) with performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing and mobile responsiveness verification
- Final visual polish to ensure authentic underground aesthetic

Run comprehensive testing across all three theme variants in multiple browsers. Verify that the underground aesthetic is consistent and authentic throughout.

Update the Action Plan with testing results and any cross-browser compatibility issues.

## Additional Notes for Vibe Coding

**Context Documents**: All prompts assume you have access to:
- `docs/Action-Plan.md` - Task status tracking
- `docs/Conversion-Plan-Full.md` - Detailed implementation specs  
- `docs/SRD-new-site.md` - Complete system requirements

**Commit Strategy**: Each phase should result in a meaningful commit with descriptive message and a PR for review before proceeding.

**Testing Approach**: Each phase includes its own testing requirements - don't skip the verification steps.

**Underground Authenticity**: Keep the underground metal community values at the forefront of every decision. When in doubt, choose authenticity over commercial polish.

**Human Intervention**: Flag any items requiring human decisions (passwords, content review, hosting config) but continue with development where possible.
